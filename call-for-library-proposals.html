<h1>Call for Library Proposals</h1>

<p>The C++ standards committee is soliciting proposals for additional library 
components. Such proposals can range from as small as the addition of a single 
signature to an existing library on up to a major framework larger than any 
current standard library component. The committee will decide whether a 
successful proposal will appear in the standard itself, as part of a larger 
technical report, as a standalone technical report, or even as a standalone 
international standard. The committee will be working on multiple library work 
items in parallel, with some of those that end up as technical reports being 
shipped when ready rather than waiting for completion of single large technical 
report. </p>

<p>This call for proposals in open ended; there is no cutoff date. As a 
practical matter, the committee is just starting a revision cycle after shipping 
C++11, and so the next year is a particularly good window of opportunity to get 
a library proposal accepted into the pipeline.</p>

<p>The committee welcomes proposals with or without formal wording (often known 
as &quot;standardese&quot;). This is a change from past practice, and is intended to 
encourage library developers to step forward with proposals.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Proposals without formal wording are requests for interest. If there is 
    sufficient interest on the part of the committee, the proposal author(s) 
    will then need to provide an updated version of the proposal that does 
    include formal wording. The committee recognizes that writing the formal 
    specification for a library component can be daunting and will make 
    additional information and help available to get new authors started.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Proposals with formal wording may also need to go through several 
    revisions before being accepted as work items, although smaller, less 
    complex proposals tend to move through the process more quickly than larger, 
    more complex major libraries.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h2>Increasing the chance of acceptance</h2>

<p>The committee evaluates each proposal on its own merits. Nevertheless, here 
are some suggestions to increase the chance of acceptance.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Base the proposal on existing practice. See the
  <a href="#Existing-practice">Existing practice</a> section below. </li>
  <li>Avoid breaking existing code. Breaking existing code puts a proposal at 
  extreme risk. If existing code has to be broken, provide an analysis 
  identifying what code breaks, whether the breakage is silent or noisy, and 
  what a user would have to do to mitigate the breakage.</li>
  <li>Avoid modifications to existing headers unless you are willing to see your 
  proposal be held until the next standard. The committee will consider both 
  proposals that address entirely new domains, and proposals to modify the 
  existing standard library, but modification of existing headers is viewed as 
  unsuitable for TRs. This is a change from past guidance.</li>
  <li>Check the
  <a href="http://cplusplus.github.com/LWG/lwg-proposal-status.html">Library 
  Proposal Status Report</a>. While you are welcome to submit a proposal that 
  competes with an existing proposal, you could also submit suggestions for 
  changes to the existing proposal.</li>
  <li>The committee is particularly interested high-level libraries that solve 
  day-to-day problems of application programmers.</li>
  <li>The committee is particularly interested in features that add usability 
  for novices and occasional programmers.</li>
  <li>The standard library already has a lot of low-level facilities, so such 
  proposals need to be particularly strong to gain traction.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="Existing-practice">Existing practice</a></h2>
<p>The committee prefers proposals that are based on existing
practice. Existing practice isn't an absolute rule, but it is an
important guideline that the committee can use to judge the risk of a
proposal.  First, a proposal must be implementable, and the best
evidence that something is implementable is that it has been
implemented. Second, if a proposal is based on existing practice, the
committee can have more confidence that the proposal solves a real
problem and that its interface serves the needs of real users.</p>

<p>The preference for existing practice doesn't necessarily mean that
  a proposal has to be exactly the same as some existing library.  A
  proposal might adjust an existing library's interface to match the style of the C++ standard 
library, or a
  proposal might attempt to reconcile the interfaces of several preexisting 
libraries, or a proposal might be based on existing practice in some other 
language.</p>

<p>The committee does occasionally adopt a completely experimental library, even 
without widespread existing practice. Such proposals are generally tiny, and 
simple enough that there is virtually no risk that widespread usage will turn up 
additional problems. And even these really simple proposals need to have been 
implemented. </p>

<h2>Guidelines for the proposal document</h2>
<p>A proposal is more than a wish. "C++ should support JPEG
  manipulation" is not a proposal. A class synopsis is not a
  proposal. Even the documentation for a widely used library isn't
  necessarily a proposal.  A proposal should include the following
  things: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Motivation and scope. What user community is this library
  intended for, what problems does it address (and what problems does
  it deliberately not address), and how is it intended to be
  used?</li>
  <li>How does it fit with the rest of the standard library as a coherent 
  whole?</li>
  <li>Design decisions. A problem usually has many solutions.  Why this 
  particular solution? How does this relate to previous work in this area, if 
  any? </li>
  <li>"Standardese." A standard is a contract between implementers and
  users, to make it possible for users to write portable code. It's
  supposed to say what implementers are permitted to do, what they're
  required to do, and what users can and can't count on. The
  "standardese" should match the general style of exposition of the
  standard, but it doesn't have to match the exact margins or
  fonts or section numbering; those things will all be changed
  anyway. </li>
</ul>

<p>These things are important so that the standardization committee
  can evaluate whether the proposal solves the problem it's intended
  to solve.  Remember that C++ committee members aren't necessarily
  experts in whatever domain you're addressing.  A clear discussion of
  motivation and design decisions is more important than finalizing
  the exact standardese wording.  You should expect a proposal to go
  through at least one revision before it's accepted, so, if the
  committee likes a proposal, there will be a later opportunity to
  adjust the precise wording.</p>

<h2>Organization of a typical proposal</h2>
<blockquote>
    <p><b><i>I. Table of Contents</i></b></p>
    <p><b><i>II. Motivation and Scope</i></b></p>
    <p><i>Why is this important? What kinds of problems does it
    address, and what kinds of programmers is it intended to support?
    Is it based on existing practice? Is there a reference
    implementation?</i></p>
    <p><i><b>III. Impact On the Standard</b></i></p>
    <p><i>What does it depend on, and what depends on it? Is it a pure
    extension, or does it require changes to standard components? Can
    it be implemented using today's compilers, or does it require
    language features that will only be available as part of C++0x?</i></p>
    <p><b><i>IV. Design Decisions</i></b></p>
    <p><i>Why did you choose the specific design that you did? What
    alternatives did you consider, and what are the tradeoffs? What
    are the consequences of your choice, for users and implementers?
    What decisions are left up to implementers? If there are any
    similar libraries in use, how do their design decisions compare to
    yours?</i></p>
    <p><b><i>V. Proposed Text for the Standard</i></b></p>
    <p><b><i>VI. Acknowledgements</i></b></p>
    <p><b><i>VII. References</i></b></p>

<h2>Submission procedures</h2>

<p>Please note that details of these procedures are likely to change. Please 
check the Library Working Group's web site (<a href="http://cplusplus.github.com/LWG/">cplusplus.github.com/LWG/</a>) 
for the latest update to submission procedures.</p>
<p>The proposal may be in PDF, HTML, or plain text formats. To submit a proposal:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Once you have written the proposal document, email
  <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">???</span> requesting a document 
  number. Be sure to include the title of the proposal document. The document 
  number will be in the form Nnnnn=yy-nnnn.&nbsp; If you circulate or otherwise 
  publish the document before it has appeared in an official committee mailing, 
  replace the N with a D (for draft). Make sure the date on the document is in 
  the form yyyy-mm-dd. These are formal ISO requirements.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Email the finished document to
<span style="background-color: #FFFF00">???</span>.</p>

  </li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">The proposal document will then appear in the next official 
committee mailing. (The term &quot;mailing&quot; dates from when documents were circulated 
by physical mail.) Mailings are published roughly two weeks before and after 
committee meetings.</p>

<p>
  You should either plan to attend a standardization committee meeting
  yourself
  (see <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/meetings">
  www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/meetings</a> for meeting
  schedules), or find someone who will present your
  proposal for you.  Getting a proposal accepted is an interactive
  process, and it is almost certain that the committee will have
  questions.  At the least, you need to be willing to respond to email
  queries.
