<h2><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>

<p>The C++ standards committee is soliciting proposals for additional library 
components. Such proposals can range from small (addition of a single 
signature to an existing library) to large (something bigger than any 
current standard library component). </p>

<p>In a change from past practice, the committee is processing multiple library 
work items in parallel, and any resulting domain specific technical reports will 
ship when ready rather than waiting for completion of single large technical 
report.</p>

<p>This call for proposals in open ended; there is no cutoff date. As a 
practical matter, the committee is early in the post-C++11 revision cycle, and so 
the next year is a particularly good window of opportunity for library proposals.</p>

<p>The committee welcomes proposals with or without formal wording (often known 
as &quot;standardese&quot;). This is a change from past practice, and is intended to 
encourage library developers to step forward with proposals.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Proposals without formal wording are requests for interest. If there is 
    sufficient interest on the part of the committee, the proposal author(s) 
    will be asked to provide an updated version of the proposal that does 
    include formal wording. The committee recognizes that writing the formal 
    specification for a library component can be daunting and will be making 
    additional information and help available to get new authors started.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Proposals with formal wording may be accepted as work items right away, 
    or may need to go through one or more 
    revisions. Because formal wording is present, the LWG can usually provide 
    far more explicit feedback than simply expressing interest. </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h2><a name="Increasing-chance-acceptance">Increasing the chance of acceptance</a></h2>

<p>The committee evaluates each proposal on its own merits. Nevertheless, here 
are some suggestions to increase the chance of acceptance.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Base the proposal on existing practice. See the
  <a href="#Existing-practice">Existing practice</a> section below. </li>
  <li>Avoid breaking existing code. Breaking existing code puts a proposal at 
  extreme risk. If existing code has to be broken, provide an analysis 
  identifying what code breaks, whether the breakage is silent or noisy, and 
  what a user would have to do to mitigate the breakage.</li>
  <li>Avoid modifications to existing headers unless you are willing to see your 
  proposal be held until the next standard. The committee will consider both 
  proposals that address entirely new domains, and proposals to modify the 
  existing standard library, but modification of existing headers is viewed as 
  unsuitable for TRs. This is a change from past guidance.</li>
  <li>Avoid dependencies on libraries other than the C++ and C standard 
  libraries. That doesn't mean that implementations can't have dependencies on 
  third party libraries, but these dependencis should not be exposed in your 
  library's interface or specification.</li>
  <li>Check the
  <a href="http://cplusplus.github.com/LWG/lwg-proposal-status.html">Library 
  Proposal Status Report</a>. While you are welcome to submit a proposal that 
  competes with an existing proposal, you could also submit suggestions for 
  changes to the existing proposal.</li>
  <li>The committee is particularly interested high-level libraries that solve 
  day-to-day problems of application programmers.</li>
  <li>The committee is particularly interested in features that add usability 
  for novices and occasional programmers.</li>
  <li>The standard library already has a lot of low-level facilities, so such 
  proposals need to be particularly strong to gain traction.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="Existing-practice">Existing practice</a></h2>
<p>The committee prefers proposals that are based on existing
practice. Existing practice isn't an absolute rule, but it is an
important guideline that the committee can use to judge the risk of a
proposal.  First, a proposal must be implementable, and the best
evidence that something is implementable is that it has been
implemented. Second, if a proposal is based on existing practice, the
committee can have more confidence that the proposal solves a real
problem and that its interface serves the needs of real users.</p>

<p>The preference for existing practice doesn't necessarily mean that
  a proposal has to be exactly the same as some existing library.  A
  proposal might adjust an existing library's interface to match the style of the C++ standard 
library, or a
  proposal might attempt to reconcile the interfaces of several preexisting 
libraries, or a proposal might be based on existing practice in some other 
language.</p>

<p>The committee does occasionally adopt a completely experimental library, even 
without widespread existing practice. Such proposals are generally tiny, and 
simple enough that there is virtually no risk that widespread usage will turn up 
additional problems. And even these really simple proposals need to have been 
implemented. </p>

<h2><a name="Guidelines">Guidelines</a> for a proposal document</h2>
<p>A proposal is more than a wish. "C++ should support JPEG
  manipulation" is not a proposal. A class synopsis is not a
  proposal. Even the documentation for a widely used library isn't
  a proposal. </p>

<p>A proposal must provide the C++ committee with the information it needs to 
determine if the proposed library component is suitable for standardization. The 
most straightforward way to do this is to answer the questions asked in the
<a href="#Organization">Organization of a typical proposal</a> section below.</p>

<p>These things are important so that the standardization committee
  can evaluate the proposal. A clear overall proposal is more important than finalizing
  the exact standardese wording.  You should expect a proposal to go
  through at least one revision before it's accepted, so if the
  committee likes a proposal, there will be a later opportunity to
  adjust the precise wording based on feedback from the committee.</p>

<p>Assume that the target of your proposal is a library technical report, unless 
it modifies an existing standard library component or header. In that case, 
assume your proposal is targeted at the standard itself. The Library Working 
Group's procedure is now to wait until technical work is complete before making 
a final decision, but the clear preference is for new libraries to go into TRs, 
while modifications go into the standard.</p>

    <p><i><b>I. Table of Contents</b></i></p>
    <p><i><b>II. Introduction</b></i></p>
    <p>A very brief high level view of your proposal, understandable by C++ 
    committee members who aren't necessarily experts in whatever domain you're 
    addressing. </p>
    <p><i><b>III. Motivation and Scope</b></i></p>
    <p><i>Why is this important? What kinds of problems does it
    address? What is the intended user community? What level of programmers 
    (novice, experienced, expert) is it intended to support? 
    What existing practice is it based on? How widespread is its use? How long 
    has it been in use? Is there a reference
    implementation and test suite available for inspection?</i></p>
    <p><i><b>IV. Impact On the Standard</b></i></p>
    <p><i>What does it depend on, and what depends on it? Is it a pure
    extension, or does it require changes to standard components? Can
    it be implemented using C++11 compilers and libraries, or does it require
    language or library features that are not part of C++11?</i></p>
    <p><i><b>V. Design Decisions</b></i></p>
    <p><i>Why did you choose the specific design that you did? What
    alternatives did you consider, and what are the tradeoffs? What
    are the consequences of your choice, for users and implementers?
    What decisions are left up to implementers? If there are any
    similar libraries in use, how do their design decisions compare to
    yours?</i></p>
    <p><i><b>VI. Proposed Text for the Standard</b></i></p>
    <p>There are two options:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <ol>
        <li>Provide full "Standardese." A standard is a contract between implementers and
  users, to make it possible for users to write portable code with specified 
        semantics. It says what implementers are permitted to do, what they're
  required to do, and what users can and can't count on. The
  "standardese" should match the general style of exposition of the
  standard, and the specific rules set out in <i>17.7, Method of description 
        (Informative) [description],</i> but it doesn't have to match the exact margins or
  fonts or section numbering; those things will all be changed
  anyway.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Begin this section &quot;To Be Provided.&quot; If your proposal doesn't 
        provide full &quot;standardese&quot;, it needs to provide an alternative way for 
        committee members to evaluate technical details. For example, by 
        providing other documentation in this section instead, or providing a 
        link to such documentation on the web.</li>
      </ol>

<h2><a name="Submission-procedures">Submission procedures</a></h2>

<p>Please note that details of these procedures are likely to change. Please 
check the <a href="http://cplusplus.github.com/LWG">Library Working Group web 
site</a> for the latest update to submission procedures.</p>
<p>The proposal may be in PDF, HTML, or plain text formats. To submit a proposal:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Once you have written the proposal document, email
  <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">???</span> requesting a document 
  number. Be sure to include the title of the proposal document. The document 
  number will be in the form Nnnnn=yy-nnnn.&nbsp; If you circulate or otherwise 
  publish the document before it has appeared in an official committee mailing, 
  replace the N with a D (for draft). Make sure the date on the document is in 
  the form yyyy-mm-dd. These are formal ISO requirements.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Email the finished document to
<span style="background-color: #FFFF00">???</span>.</p>

  </li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">The proposal document will then appear in the next official 
committee mailing.  The term &quot;mailing&quot; dates from when documents were circulated 
by physical mail. Mailings are published roughly two weeks before and after 
committee meetings, with mid-term mailings half way between meetings added to 
the schedule when needed.</p>

<p>
  The proposal is then presented to the LWG at the next C++ committee meeting 
  (see <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/meetings">
  www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/meetings</a> for meeting schedules).
  You should plan to attend and present your proposal yourself , or ensure that someone who 
  understands your
  proposal can present it for you.  Getting a proposal accepted is an interactive
  process, and it is almost certain that the committee will have
  questions.  At the least, you need to be willing to respond to email
  queries.
