<h1>Call for Library Proposals</h1>

<p>The C++ standards committee is soliciting proposals for additional library 
components.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Such library components would appear in either library technical reports or 
in the C++ standard library itself. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The committee will consider both proposals that address entirely new domains, 
and proposals to modify the existing standard library.</p>

<p>The committee especially welcomes proposals in the following areas: </p>
<ul>
  <li> Unicode </li>
  <li> XML and HTML </li>
  <li> Networking </li>
  <li> Usability for novices and occasional programmers</li>
</ul>

<p>Although each proposal will be evaluated on its own merits, the
  committee is more interested in high-level libraries that solve
  day-to-day problems of application programmers than in low-level
  infrastructure.
</p>

<p>The committee welcomes proposals with or without formal wording (often known 
as &quot;standardese&quot;).
</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Proposals without formal wording are requests for interest. If there is 
    sufficient interest on the part of the committee, the proposal author(s) 
    will need to provide an updated version of the proposal that does include 
    formal wording. The committee recognizes that writing the formal 
    specification for a library component can be daunting and will make 
    additional information and help available to get new authors started.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Proposals with formal wording... </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Guidelines</h2>
<p>A proposal is more than a wish. "C++ should support JPEG
  manipulation" is not a proposal. A class synopsis is not a
  proposal. Even the documentation for a widely used library isn't
  necessarily a proposal.  A proposal should include the following
  things: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Motivation and scope. What user community is this library
  intended for, what problems does it address (and what problems does
  it deliberately not address), and how is it intended to be
  used?</li>
  <li>How does it fit with the rest of the standard library as a coherent 
  whole?</li>
  <li>Design decisions. A problem usually has many solutions.  Why this 
  particular solution? How does this relate to previous work in this area, if 
  any? </li>
  <li>"Standardese." A standard is a contract between implementers and
  users, to make it possible for users to write portable code. It's
  supposed to say what implementers are permitted to do, what they're
  required to do, and what users can and can't count on. The
  "standardese" should match the general style of exposition of the
  standard, but it doesn't have to match the exact margins or
  fonts or section numbering; those things will all be changed
  anyway. </li>
</ul>

<p>These things are important so that the standardization committee
  can evaluate whether the proposal solves the problem it's intended
  to solve.  Remember that C++ committee members aren't necessarily
  experts in whatever domain you're addressing.  A clear discussion of
  motivation and design decisions is more important than finalizing
  the exact standardese wording.  You should expect a proposal to go
  through at least one revision before it's accepted, so, if the
  committee likes a proposal, there will be a later opportunity to
  adjust the precise wording.</p>

<h2>Existing practice</h2>
<p>The committee prefers proposals that are based on existing
practice. Existing practice isn't an absolute rule, but it is an
important guideline that the committee can use to judge the risk of a
proposal.  First, a proposal must be implementable, and the best
evidence that something is implementable is that it has been
implemented. Second, if a proposal is based on existing practice, the
committee can have more confidence that the proposal solves a real
problem and that its interface serves the needs of real users.</p>

<p>The preference for existing practice doesn't necessarily mean that
  a proposal has to be exactly the same as some existing library.  A
  proposal might be adjust an existing library's interface to make it
  more like the style used elsewhere in the C++ standard, or a
  proposal might be an attempt to reconcile the interfaces of several
  preexisting libraries, or a proposal might be based on existing
  practice in some other language. In rare cases the committee might
  be willing to adopt a completely experimental library, even without
  widespread existing practice, if the proposal is sufficiently
  compelling.</p>

<h2>Organization of a typical proposal</h2>
<blockquote>
    <p><b><i>I. Table of Contents</i></b></p>
    <p><b><i>II. Motivation and Scope</i></b></p>
    <p><i>Why is this important? What kinds of problems does it
    address, and what kinds of programmers is it intended to support?
    Is it based on existing practice? Is there a reference
    implementation?</i></p>
    <p><i><b>III. Impact On the Standard</b></i></p>
    <p><i>What does it depend on, and what depends on it? Is it a pure
    extension, or does it require changes to standard components? Can
    it be implemented using today's compilers, or does it require
    language features that will only be available as part of C++0x?</i></p>
    <p><b><i>IV. Design Decisions</i></b></p>
    <p><i>Why did you choose the specific design that you did? What
    alternatives did you consider, and what are the tradeoffs? What
    are the consequences of your choice, for users and implementers?
    What decisions are left up to implementers? If there are any
    similar libraries in use, how do their design decisions compare to
    yours?</i></p>
    <p><b><i>V. Proposed Text for the Standard</i></b></p>
    <p><b><i>VI. Acknowledgements</i></b></p>
    <p><b><i>VII. References</i></b></p>

<h2>Proposal examples</h2>
<p>Successful proposals for TR1 can be used as models. Examples include:</p>
<ul>

</ul>

<h2>Submission procedures</h2>

<p>Please note that details of these procedures are likely to change. Please 
check the Library Working Group's unofficial web site (<a href="http://cplusplus.github.com/LWG/">cplusplus.github.com/LWG/</a>) 
for the latest update to submission procedures.</p>
<p>The proposal may be in PDF, HTML, or plain text formats. To submit a proposal:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Once you have written the proposal document, email
  <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">???</span> requesting a document 
  number. Be sure to include the title of the proposal document. The document 
  number will be in the form Nnnnn=yy-nnnn.&nbsp; If you circulate or otherwise 
  publish the document before it has appeared in an official committee mailing, 
  replace the N with a D (for draft). Make sure the date on the document is in 
  the form yyyy-mm-dd. These are formal ISO requirements.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Email the finished document to
<span style="background-color: #FFFF00">???</span>.</p>

  </li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">The proposal document will then appear in the next official 
committee mailing. (The term &quot;mailing&quot; dates from when documents were circulated 
by physical mail.) Mailings are published roughly two weeks before and after 
committee meetings.</p>

<p>
  You should either plan to attend a standardization committee meeting
  yourself
  (see <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/meetings">
  www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/meetings</a> for meeting
  schedules), or find someone who will present your
  proposal for you.  Getting a proposal accepted is an interactive
  process, and it is almost certain that the committee will have
  questions.  At the least, you need to be willing to respond to email
  queries.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
  Most proposals should be targeted for TR2, not for C++0x. A C++0x
  library proposal will be judged by much stricter standards than a
  TR2 proposal.  A C++0x proposal will be accepted only if it can be
  shown to be very low risk and only if the committee is certain that
  it can be finalized without jeopardizing the schedule for C++0x.
  Experimental proposals will not be considered for C++0x.  For TR2,
  however, the committee will be less conservative.</p>

<p>
   Proposals for C++0x library extensions must be received by October 1, 2005.
   Proposals for TR2 library extensions must be received by October 1, 2006.
