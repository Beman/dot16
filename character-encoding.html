<h1>Making C++2x Friendlier to Unicode</h1>

<p>Proposes editorial, near-editorial, and substantive changes aimed at making 
the specification of the standard friendlier to Unicode, and easier to 
understand by human beings. Most of the proposed changes are 
to the core language, but the primary impact of the changes is on the current 
standard library, and on Unicode-related standard library proposals in the pipeline. Users 
and implementors both benefit because sources of confusion are eliminated, some 
possibly non-portable uses of <code>wchar_t</code> in the library become fully 
portable.</p>

<p>Only specifications are changed; no new functionality is proposed. C and C++ 
compilers such as GCC, Clang, and VC++ have conformed to the proposed changes 
for years. So the impact of the proposal is 
to bring the standard into alignment with what compilers and libraries already do; i.e. 
standardize existing practice.</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>The motivation for this proposal is long-term irritation over the following 
two concerns. Both are addressed together to ensure that sufficient context is 
presented and to achieve overall consistency.</p>

<p><b>Existing practice for the <code>wchar_t</code> 
character set and encoding converged on ISO/IEC 10646 (i.e. Unicode), UTF encoded, years ago 
but the C++ standard has not kept pace</b></p>

<p>GCC has treated 
the character set of <code>wchar_t</code> as ISO/IEC 10646, UTF encoded, since 
2000 or 2001. Microsoft did so even earlier, and Clang did so from its 
inception. Other compilers followed their lead. UTF encoded ISO/IEC 10646 is highly 
desirable from both user and standard library perspectives.</p>

<p>Some knowledgeable readers, however, believe that the standard allows an 
implementation to treat <code>wchar_t</code> as having a much smaller character set and 
use a much more limited encoding, such as EBCDIC. Indeed, IBM XL C/C++ for 
the z/OS operating system does just that, although UTF encoded ISO/IEC 
10646 is also supported.</p>

<p>This divergence between existing practice and the standard has negative consequences:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Programs using <code>wchar_t</code> are seen by some as inherently 
  non-portable.</li>
  <li>Standard codecvt facets that traffic in <code>wchar_t</code> strings are seen as by some inherently non-portable.</li>
  <li>It complicates Unicode related standard library proposals.</li>
  <li>It runs up support costs for third-party libraries like Boost that use the 
  standard library features in question.</li>
</ul>

<p>The proposed fix is to specify the <code>wchar_t</code> character set as ISO/IEC 
10646t, UTF encoded. </p>

<p><b>Even knowledgeable readers become confused or disagree about wide 
character specifications</b></p>

<p>The first sentence of [basic.fundamental] paragraph 5 is one example of why 
knowledgeable readers can become confused or disagree:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&quot;Type <code>wchar_t</code> is a distinct type whose values can represent 
distinct codes for all members of the largest extended character set specified 
among the supported locales (22.3.1).&quot;</p>

  <ul>
    <li>It is unclear if &quot;distinct codes&quot; means &quot;distinct code units&quot; or 
    &quot;distinct code points&quot;.</li>
    <li>The term &quot;extended character set&quot; is defined nowhere in the standard, 
    although we do know from [defns.multibyte] that it is related to &quot;source or 
    execution environment&quot; and a non-normative note says that it &quot;is a superset 
    of the basic character set (2.3)&quot; .</li>
    <li>The term &quot;supported locales&quot; is neither defined nor used 
    elsewhere in the standard.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>The proposed fix is to make a coherent set of editorial and near-editorial 
changes to clarify the existing specification.</p>

<h2>Summary of proposed changes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Specify the value of a <code>wchar_t</code> character literal as a UTF encoded ISO 
  10646 code point value.</li>
  <li>Synchronize the specification of all string literal types to use wording 
  in the same 
  form.</li>
  <li>Clarify the specification of the size of a <code>wchar_t</code> string literal by using 
  the term &quot;code unit&quot;.</li>
  <li>Simplify and clarify the specification of type <code>wchar_t</code> by using the terms 
  &quot;code point&quot; and &quot;code unit&quot;.</li>
  <li>Remove the term &quot;basic execution wide-character set&quot; as 
  confusing and not needed.</li>
  <li>Add a new library section 17.6.3.6 Character sequence requirements [utility.req.encoding] 
  specifying the library&#39;s default treatment for the encoding of strings and 
  other sequences of character types.</li>
  <li>Change the example in [conversions.string] to focus on portably using
  <code>wchar_t</code>.</li>
  <li>Fix an incorrect use of &quot;basic execution wide-character set&quot; in [fs.def.native.encode].</li>
</ul>

<h2>History of wchar_t&nbsp; encoding</h2>

<p><code>wchar_t</code> was introduced in ISO C90 standard. A specific character 
set and encoding was not specified. </p>

<p>Markus Kuhn&#39;s Unicode FAQ (<a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/unicode.html">www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/unicode.html</a>)&nbsp; 
describes what happened next:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, <var>wchar_t</var> was already widely used for various Asian 
16-bit encodings throughout the 1990s. Therefore, the ISO C 99 standard was 
bound by backwards compatibility. It could not be changed to require <var>
wchar_t</var> to be used with UCS, like Java and Ada95 managed to do.</p>
<p>Starting with GNU glibc 2.2, the type <samp>wchar_t</samp> is officially 
intended to be used only for 32-bit ISO 10646 values, independent of the 
currently used locale.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>GNU glibc 2.2 shipped in 2000, so from that point on GCC treated <code>
wchar_t</code> as the ISO 10646 (i.e. Unicode) character set encoded as UTF-32.</p>

<p>Microsoft Visual C/C++ always treated&nbsp; <code>wchar_t</code> as ISO 
10646. The encoding was initially UCS-2, later modernized to UTF-16.</p>

<p>Clang always treated&nbsp; <code>wchar_t</code> as ISO 10646 encoded as 
UTF-32.</p>

<p>Some compilers, such as IBM XL C/C++ for the z/OS operating system, support 
several character sets and encodings for&nbsp; <code>wchar_t</code>, including 
ISO 10646 with UTF encoding. </p>

<h2>Proposed Wording</h2>

<p><i>This proposed wording assumes P0417, </i>C++17 should refer to ISO/IEC 
10646 2014 instead of 1994<i>, has been accepted into the C++ working paper.</i></p>

<p><i>Strike the wording <del>high-lighted in red</del> and add the wording <ins>high-lighted in 
green</ins>. Some standard text that is not changed is shown below to ensure sufficient 
context to evaluate the proposed changes.</i></p>
<h3>2.13.3 Character literals [lex.ccon]</h3>
<p><sup>2</sup> A character literal that does not begin with <code>u8</code>, 
<code>u</code>, <code>U</code>, or 
<code>L</code> is an <i>ordinary character literal</i>. An ordinary character literal that contains 
a single <i>c-char</i> representable in the execution character set has type 
<code>char</code>, with 
value equal to the numerical value of the encoding of the <i>c-char</i> in the 
execution character set. An ordinary character literal that contains more than 
one <i>c-char</i> is a <i>multicharacter</i> literal. A multicharacter literal, 
or an ordinary character literal containing a single <i>c-char</i> not 
representable in the execution character set, is conditionally-supported, has 
type <code>int</code>, and has an implementation-defined value.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup> A character literal that begins with <code>u8</code>, such as
<code>u8’w</code>’, is a character literal of type <code>char</code>, known as a
<i>UTF-8<br>
character literal</i>. The value of a UTF-8 character literal is equal to its 
ISO 10646 code point value, provided<br>
that the code point value is representable with a single UTF-8 code unit (that 
is, provided it is in the C0<br>
Controls and Basic Latin Unicode block). If the value is not representable with 
a single UTF-8 code unit,<br>
the program is ill-formed. A UTF-8 character literal containing multiple <i>
c-chars</i> is ill-formed.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup> A character literal that begins with the letter <code>u</code>, 
such as <code>u’x’</code>, is a character literal of type <code>char16_t</code>. 
The<br>
value of a <code>char16_t</code> literal containing a single <i>c-char</i> is 
equal to its ISO 10646 code point value, provided that<br>
the code point is representable with a single 16-bit code unit. (That is, 
provided it is a basic multi-lingual<br>
plane code point.) If the value is not representable within 16 bits, the program 
is ill-formed. A <code>char16_t</code><br>
literal containing multiple <i>c-chars</i> is ill-formed.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup> A character literal that begins with the letter <code>U</code>, 
such as <code>U’y’</code>, is a character literal of type <code>char32_t</code>. 
The<br>
value of a <code>char32_t</code> literal containing a single <i>c-char</i> is 
equal to its ISO 10646 code point value. A <code>char32_t</code><br>
literal containing multiple <i>c-chars</i> is ill-formed.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup> A character literal that begins with the letter <code>L</code>, such as
<code>L’z’</code>, is a wide-character literal. A wide-character literal has type
<code>wchar_t</code>. 
The value of a wide-character literal containing a single <i>c-char</i>
<del>has value equal 
to the numerical value of the encoding of the <i>c-char</i> in the execution 
wide-character set, unless the <i>c-char</i> has no representation in the execution 
wide-character set, in which case the value is implementation-defined. [ Note: 
The type <code>wchar_t </code>is able to represent all members of the execution 
wide-character set (see 3.9.1). —end note ]. The value of a wide-character 
literal containing multiple <i>c-chars</i> is implementation-defined.</del> <ins>is 
equal to its ISO 10646 code point value, provided that code point value is 
representable with a single UTF encoded code unit. If the value is not representable 
with a single UTF encoded code unit, the program is ill-formed. The specific 
UTF form is determined by the size of <code>wchar_t</code>. A 
wide-character&nbsp;literal containing multiple <i>c-chars</i> is ill-formed.</ins></p>

<h3>2.13.5 String literals [lex.string]</h3>
<p><sup>7</sup> A <i>string-literal</i> that begins with <code>u8</code>, 
such as <code>u8&quot;asdf&quot;</code>, is a UTF-8 string literal.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup> Ordinary string literals and UTF-8 string literals are 
also referred to as narrow string literals. A narrow string literal has type 
“array of <i>n</i> <code>const char</code>”, where <i>n</i> is the size of the 
string as defined below, and has static storage duration (3.7).</p>
<p><sup>9</sup> For a UTF-8 string literal, each successive element of 
the object representation (3.9) has the value of the corresponding code unit of 
the UTF-8 encoding of the string.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup> A <i>string-literal</i> that begins with <code>u</code>, 
such as <code>u&quot;asdf&quot;</code>, is a <code>char16_t</code> string literal. A <code>
char16_t</code> string literal has type “array of <i>n</i> <code>const char16_t</code>”, 
where <i>n</i> is the size of the string as defined below; <del>it is initialized 
with the given characters</del> <ins>each successive element of 
the object representation  has the value of the corresponding code unit of 
the UTF-16 encoding of the string</ins>. A single <i>c-char</i> may produce more than one
<code>char16_t</code> character in the form of surrogate pairs.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup> A <i>string-literal</i> that begins with <code>U</code>, 
such as <code>U&quot;asdf&quot;</code>, is a <code>char32_t</code> string literal. A <code>
char32_t</code> string literal has type “array of <i>n</i> <code>const char32_t</code>”, 
where <i>n</i> is the size of the string as defined below; <del>it is initialized 
with the given characters</del> <ins>each successive element of 
the object representation  has the value of the corresponding code unit of 
the UTF-32 encoding of the string</ins>.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup> A <i>string-literal</i> that begins with <code>L</code>, 
such as <code>L&quot;asdf&quot;</code>, is a wide string literal. A wide string literal 
has type “array of <i>n</i> <code>const wchar_t</code>”, where <i>n</i> is the 
size of the string as defined below; <del>it is initialized 
with the given characters</del> <ins>each successive element of the object 
representation  has the value of the corresponding code unit of the UTF encoding of the 
string.</ins></p>
<p><sup>15</sup> Escape sequences and universal-character-names in 
non-raw string literals have the same meaning as in character literals (2.13.3), 
except that the single quote <code>’</code> is representable either by itself or 
by the escape sequence <code>\’</code>, and the double quote <code>&quot;</code> 
shall be preceded by a <code>\</code>, and except that a 
universal-character-name in a <code>char16_t</code> string literal may yield a 
surrogate pair. In a narrow string literal, a universal-character-name may map 
to more than one char element due to multibyte encoding. The size of a <code>
char32_t</code> <del>or wide</del> string literal is the total number of escape sequences, 
universal-character-names, and other characters, plus one for the terminating
<code>U’\0’</code><del> or L’\0’</del>. The size of a <code>char16_t</code> 
string literal is the total number of escape sequences, 
universal-character-names, and other characters, plus one for each character 
requiring a surrogate pair, plus one for the terminating <code>u’\0’</code>. [ Note: The size of a <code>char16_t</code> string literal is the number of code 
units, not the number of characters. —end note ] <ins>The size of a <code>wchar_t</code> string literal is the total number of 
code units necessary to represent the code points for all escape sequences, 
universal-character-names, and other characters, plus one for the terminating
<code>L’\0’</code>.</ins> Within <ins><code>wchar_t</code>,</ins> <code>char32_t</code> 
and <code>char16_t</code> literals, any universal-character-names shall be 
within the range <code>0x0</code> to <code>0x10FFFF</code>. The size of a narrow 
string literal is the total number of escape sequences and other characters, 
plus at least one for the multibyte encoding of each universal-character-name, 
plus one for the terminating <code>’\0’</code>.</p>
<h3>2.3 Character sets [lex.charset]</h3>
<p dir="ltr"><sup>3</sup> The <i>basic execution character set</i> <del>and the <i>basic execution wide-character</i> set</del> 
shall <del>each</del> contain all the members of the basic source character set, plus 
control characters representing alert, backspace, and carriage return, plus a 
<i>null character </i><del>(respectively, null wide character)</del>, whose value is 0. 
<ins>There may be multiple basic execution character sets.</ins> For each basic execution character set, the
values of the members of the basic execution character set shall be non-negative 
and distinct from one another. In both the source and execution basic character 
sets, the value of each character after 0 in the above list of decimal digits 
shall be one greater than the value of the previous. The <i>execution character set</i>
<del>and the execution wide-character set are</del> <ins>is an</ins> implementation-defined superset<del>s</del> of the 
basic execution character <del>set</del> <ins>sets and may contain additional 
members</ins> <del>and the basic execution wide-character set, 
respectively</del>. The values of the members of the execution character sets and the 
sets of additional members <del>are</del> <ins>may be</ins> locale-specific.</p>
<h3>3.9.1 Fundamental types [basic.fundamental]</h3>
<p><sup>5</sup> Type <code>wchar_t</code> is a distinct type whose values can represent 
distinct <del>codes</del> <ins>code units</ins> for all <del>members of the largest extended character set specified 
among the supported locales (22.3.1).</del> <ins>code points defined by ISO/IEC 10646.</ins> Type <code>wchar_t</code> shall have the 
same size, signedness, and alignment requirements (3.11) as one of the other 
integral types, called its underlying type. Types <code>char16_t</code> and
<code>char32_t</code> denote distinct types with the same size, signedness, and 
alignment as <code>uint_least16_t</code> and <code>uint_least32_t</code>, 
respectively, in <code>&lt;cstdint&gt;</code>, called the underlying types.</p>
<h3>16.8 Predefined macro names [cpp.predefined]</h3>
<p><sup>2</sup> <code>__STDC_ISO_10646__</code><br>
An integer literal of the form <code>yyyymmL</code> (for example, <code>199712L</code>). 
If this symbol is defined, then every
character in the Unicode required set, when stored in an object of type <code>
wchar_t</code>, has the same value as
the short identifier of that character. The <i>Unicode required set </i>consists 
of all the characters that are
defined by ISO/IEC 10646, along with all amendments and technical corrigenda as 
of the specified year
and month</p>
<h3><ins>17.6.3.6 Character sequence requirements [utility.req.encoding]</ins></h3>
<p><ins>Unless otherwise specified, the encoding of strings and  
sequences of narrow character types and types <code>char16_t</code>, <code>char32_t</code>, 
and <code>wchar_t</code> shall be treated as having the same encoding as character literals of 
those types ([lex.ccon]). [<i>Note</i>: those encodings are the encoding of the execution 
character set, UTF-16, UTF-32, and a size-dependent UTF encoding, respectively. 
&mdash;<i>end note</i>]</ins></p>
<h3>22.3.3.2.2 string conversions [conversions.string]</h3>
<p><sup><font face="Arial">1</font></sup> Class template <code>wstring_convert</code> 
performs conversions between a wide string and a byte string. It lets you 
specify a code conversion facet (like class template <code>codecvt</code>) to 
perform the conversions, without affecting any streams or locales. [ <i>Example:</i> If 
you <ins>often</ins> want to use the code conversion facet <code>codecvt_utf8</code> to <del>output to
<code>cout</code></del> <ins>create</ins> a UTF-8 multibyte sequence corresponding to a wide string<del>, but 
you don’t want to alter the locale for <code>cout</code></del>, you can write 
something like:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre><del>wstring_convert&lt;std::codecvt_utf8&lt;wchar_t&gt;&gt; myconv;
std::string mbstring = myconv.to_bytes(L&quot;Hello\n&quot;);
std::cout &lt;&lt; mbstring;</del></pre>
  <pre><ins>std::string utf8(std::wstring_view v) {
  static std::wstring_convert&lt;std::codecvt_utf8&lt;wchar_t&gt;&gt; myconv;
  return myconv.to_bytes(v.cbegin(), v.cend());
}
...
std:wstring my_wstr;
...
my_wstr = L&quot;你好，世界&quot;;
...
std::cout &lt;&lt; utf8(my_wstr);</ins></pre>
</blockquote>
<p><ins>This code is portable regardless of whether the encoding of <code>wchar_t</code> 
strings is UTF-8, UTF-16, or UTF-32.</ins></p>

<h3>27.10.4.10 native encoding [fs.def.native.encode]</h3>
<p dir="ltr">For narrow character strings <ins>and sequences</ins>, the operating system dependent current encoding
