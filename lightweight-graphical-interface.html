<p align="center"><b><font size="4">Objectives, Requirements, Strategies</font></b></p>

  <p align="left">This paper represents thoughts about the objectives, 
  requirements, and strategies I presented at the initial meeting of the SG13 
  Study Group in Chicago, 2013-Sept-28. These are my personal views and do not 
  necessarily represent the views of other SG13 members.</p>
  <h2 align="left">Objective: Success</h2>
  <p align="left">This paper isn't about the technical aspects of a library 
  Technical Specification (TS) for lightweight graphical interface - rather it 
  presents an approach to creating such a TS in a way that maximizes the chance 
  of success by avoiding minefields.</p>
  <h2 align="left">Elephants in the room and differing expectations</h2>
  <p align="left">There are major players in the problem domain - Microsoft, 
  Apple, Open GL, QT, and the list goes on and on. Also, expectations differ 
  widely as soon as we start talking about a graphical interface TS.</p>
  <p align="left">A strategy to defuse concern about undue competition and to 
  calibrate expectations is to put &quot;lightweight&quot; or a synonym in the title of 
  both the SG and the TS. Examples of this strategy include &quot;Concepts Lite&quot; and 
  some internal Boost components that use &quot;Lightweight&quot; in the title to avoided 
  conflicts and limited expectations.</p>
  <h2 align="left">Avoiding design by committee</h2>
  <p align="left">A lightweight graphical interface, even though far simpler 
  that a full-fledged GUI framework, is far too complex to be successfully 
  designed by a committee. Strategies are presented that taken together 
  addresses this concern.</p>
  <h2 align="left">Strategy: Ship in two years</h2>
  <p align="left">That implies a major feature complete working draft in one or 
  two meetings. I.E. There is no time for design by committee.</p>
  <p align="left">Furthermore, we need a working implementation (on GitHub or 
  similar) that is kept in sync with the working draft. That's the only way to 
  have confidence that the WD is implementable and useful to users.</p>
  <h2 align="left">Strategy: Starting point is an existing successful library 
  already in wide use</h2>
  <p align="left">Starting with an existing successful library that is already 
  in wide use avoids design by committee and gives the SG and standards 
  committee enough confidence that we can move forward quickly.</p>
  <p align="left">The strategy for accepting the STL into the standard is a 
  useful role model. The whole STL proposal was put in the standard working 
  draft, and only then were changes allowed. This had the effect of moving the 
  STL forward quickly and limiting design by committee related problems.</p>
  <p align="left">Once SG13 has a working draft, we can accept changes of any 
  magnitude based on the merits of their proposals. If someone comes forward 
  with a proposal to completely replace the library as specified in the WD, that 
  proposal obviously would have to be very strong to make progress. Smaller 
  proposals, particularly those that have been implemented (presumably as a 
  branch of the GitHub implementation), might well be accepted, and small tweak 
  proposals will certainly be accepted. But at each step of the way, we have a 
  complete WD and reference implementation.</p>
  <h2 align="left">Requirements for a starting point library</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
    <p align="left">Existing successful library already in wide use.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
    <li>
    <p align="left">Modern C++, modulo naming conventions and C++11/14 features. 
    (Dependencies hidden from users are exempt from this requirement.)<br>
&nbsp;</li>
    <li>
    <p align="left">Extendible by third-parties. An initial library TS completed 
    in a short time frame may be quite limited. That will be much more acceptable if 
    the library is extendible by third parties.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
    <li>
    <p align="left">Copyright or other intellectual property holder willing to 
    meet ISO intellectual property requirements. It would also be helpful if the 
    original developers were willing to get involved in SG work.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
    <li>
    <p align="left">Meets Beman's challenge: &quot;Display <i>Hello C++ World</i> in 
    a window and allow the user to drag that text around inside the window with 
    a program that is only slightly more complex that the traditional hello 
    world program.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;</li>
    <li>
    <p align="left">Meets Herb's challenge: &quot;Learn the library basics and build 
    an interesting app in four hours or less.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;</li>
    <li>
    <p align="left">Some other challenges or requirements may evolve, as long as 
    they don't eliminate all candidates.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 align="left">Does any existing library meet these requirements?</h2>
  <p align="left">Cinder (<a href="http://libcinder.org/">libcinder.org/</a>) 
  seems to come reasonably close, although there has been no in-depth analysis 
  yet. Presumably there are other existing lightweight libraries that SG9 can 
  investigate.</p>
  <p align="left">Here are two videos showing the Cinder results for Herb's 
  challenge at the Going Native 2013 conference:</p>
