<p align="center"><b><font size="4">Objectives, Requirements, Strategies</font></b></p>

  <p align="left">This paper represents thoughts about the objectives, 
  requirements, and strategies I presented at the initial meeting of the SG13 
  Study Group in Chicago, 2013-Sept-28. These are my personal views and do not 
  necessarily represent the views of other SG13 members.</p>
  <h2 align="left">Objective: Success</h2>
  <p align="left">This paper isn't about the technical aspects of a library 
  Technical Specification (TS) for lightweight graphical interface - rather it 
  presents an approach to creating such a TS in a way that maximizes the chance 
  of success by avoiding minefields.</p>
  <h2 align="left">Elephants in the room and differing expectations</h2>
  <p align="left">There are major players in the problem domain - Microsoft, 
  Apple, Open GL, QT, and the list goes on and on. Also, expectations differ 
  widely as soon as we start talking about a graphical interface TS.</p>
  <p align="left">A strategy to defuse concern about undue competition and to 
  calibrate expectations is to put &quot;lightweight&quot; or a synonym in the title of 
  both the SG and the TS. Examples include &quot;Concepts Lite&quot; and some internal 
  Boost components that use &quot;Lightweight&quot; in the title and have successfully 
  avoided conflicts and limited expectations.</p>
  <h2 align="left">Avoiding design by committee</h2>
  <p align="left">A lightweight graphical interface, even though far simpler 
  that a full-fledged GUI framework, is far too complex to be successfully 
  designed by a committee. Strategies are presented that taken together 
  addresses this concern.</p>
  <h2 align="left">Strategy: Ship in two years</h2>
  <p align="left">That implies a major feature complete working draft in two 
  meeting. I.E. There is no time for design by committee.</p>
  <p align="left">Furthermore, there is a working implementation (on GitHub or 
  similar) in sync with the working draft. That's the only way to have 
  confidence that the WD is implementable and useful to users.</p>
  <h2 align="left">Strategy: WD starting point is an existing successful library 
  already in wide use</h2>
  <p align="left">Starting with an existing successful library that is already 
  in wide use avoids design by committee and gives the SG and standards 
  committee enough confidence that we can move forward quickly.</p>
  <p align="left">The strategy for accepting the STL into the standard is a 
  useful role model. The whole STL proposal was put in the standard working 
  draft, and only then were changes allowed. </p>
  <p align="left">Once SG13 has a working draft, we can accept changes of any 
  magnitude based on their merits. If someone comes forward with a proposal to 
  completely replace the library as specified in the WD, that proposal obviously 
  would have to be very strong to make progress. Smaller proposals, particularly 
  those that have been implemented (presumably as a branch of the GitHub 
  implementation), might well be accepted, and small tweak proposals will 
  certainly be accepted.\</p>
  <h2 align="left">Requirements for a starting point library</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
    <p align="left">Existing successful library already in wide use.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
    <li>
    <p align="left">Modern C++ that uses the C++ standard library where 
    applicable, modulo naming conventions and C++11/14 features. (Dependencies 
    hidden from users are exempt from this requirement.)<br>
&nbsp;</li>
    <li>
    <p align="left">Extendible by third-parties. An initial library TS in a 
    short time frame will be quite limited. That's much more acceptable if the 
    library is extendible by third parties.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
    <li>
    <p align="left">Owner willing to meet ISO intellectual property 
    requirements. It would also be helpful if the original developers were 
    willing to get involved in SG work.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
    <li>
    <p align="left">Meets Beman's &quot;Hello C++ World&quot; challenge; displaying that 
    text in a window and being able to drag it around inside the window is only 
    slightly more complex that the traditional Hello world program.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
    <li>
    <p align="left">Meets Herb's &quot;Learn the library basics and build an 
    interesting app in four hours&quot; challenge.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
    <li>
    <p align="left">There may be some other challenges or requirements, as long 
    as they don't eliminate all candidates.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 align="left">Does any existing library meet these requirements?</h2>
