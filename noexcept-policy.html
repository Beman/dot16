<h1>Policy for standard library use of noexcept</h1>

&gt;&gt; I don't get it.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; We were told in Madrid to be conservative in the use of noexcept, and<br>
&gt;&gt; in particular not to use noexcept on functions that have preconditions<br>
&gt;&gt; (I.e. Requires elements.) See N3279.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; You should ignore this bad advice. Normally I'd say, &quot;IMO&quot; just to be<br>
&gt;&gt; polite, but I don't feel I should do anything to soften this statement.<br>
&gt;&gt; Preconditions and exceptions have no intrinsic relationship, and nothing<br>
&gt;&gt; should be done to artificially connect them.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; In the wonderful world of well-formed programs, Dave is correct.<br>
&gt;&gt; In the practical world of supporting potentially buggy software, we often<br>
&gt;&gt; want to offer library modes that help users find their problems quickly.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I know all the arguments. Such library modes are allowed as extensions<br>
&gt; and shouldn't be written into the library spec.<br>
<br>
Strongly agree.<br>

<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>Clause 17 does not state overall policy for the use of noexcept in the 
standard library, except to allow implementers to add noexcept to non-virtual 
functions.</p>
<p>That creates several problems:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Library use of 17 is not subject to serious scrutiny</li>
</ul>
<p>As long as the LWG's policy on use of noexcept is not described in 17, 
library use of 17 is not subject to serious scrutiny by those not privy to the 
inner workings of the LWG. That includes both committee members and others who 
do not normally attend LWG discussions.</p>
<ul>
  <li>There is currently no way to know if noexcept applies to functions like 
  iterator member functions that are required by the standard, but do not appear 
  in any synopsis.</li>
</ul>
<p>By attempting to set a policy, serious debate can occur as to what the policy 
should be. This is important since several committee members believe the Nxxxx 
guidelines are not suitable for long term use.</p>
