<h1>Policy for standard library use of noexcept</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2011/n3279.pdf">
N3279</a>, <i>Conservative use of noexcept in the Library</i>, specifies the 
current policy governing use of noexcept in the standard library. The portion of 
that policy at issue here is the bullet item that reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Each library function having a wide contract, that the LWG agree cannot 
throw, should be marked as unconditionally noexcept.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wide contract functions are those that never specify behavior as undefined. 
Narrow contract functions are those that may exhibit undefined behavior, such as 
functions with <i>Requires</i> elements. Because narrow contract functions are 
excluded from the policy, they are not allowed to be marked noexcept, even if 
the LWG agrees the function cannot throw.</p>
<h2>Problems with current wide/narrow policy</h2>
<h3>Almost no function is actually wide</h3>
<p>Peter Dimov: &quot;(almost) no function is actually wide. All functions have 
implicit requirements that their arguments, *this, and everything else reachable 
from them be a valid object. (Or, in the case of a constructor, that 'this' 
points to storage suitable to hold an object.)&quot;</p>
<h3>Creates creates conflict between Requires and noexcept</h3>
<p>Peter Dimov: &quot;[The policy is] also wrong because it sets up a conflict. When 
specifying, say, operator*, we now need to make a choice between adding a 
Requires clause and a noexcept, the two being mutually exclusive under the wide/narrow theory. This 
  does not improve the quality of the specification.&quot;</p>
<p>Dave Abrahams: &quot;Preconditions and exceptions have no intrinsic relationship, 
and nothing should be done to artificially connect them.&quot;</p>
<h3>Forces users to pay for something they will not use</h3>
<p>The motivation for the current policy is allow library implementations to 
test their assertions of preconditions by throwing exceptions. Ordinary users of 
the library will have pay the often considerable increased cost of a function 
that is not marked noexcept even though they will see only assertions on 
precondition failures and never exceptions.</p>
<h3>Unnecessarily exposes implementation detail</h3>
<p>How a library implementation tests itself is an implementation detail. 
Allowing details of how a library tests itself to escape into the interface is a 
poor design practice.</p>
<h2>Proposed resolution</h2>
<p>Jeffrey Yasskin: &quot;<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2011/n3279.pdf">N3279</a> 
documents the current guidelines, but these aren't recorded anywhere more 
official where we could apply patches.&quot;</p>
<p>Beman Dawes: &quot;Because the policy guidelines are buried in a paper, rather 
than a working document, they are not subject to sufficient review and 
oversight.&quot;</p>
<h2>Proposed wording</h2>
<p><i>At a location to be determined, in a document to be determined, add:</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wide Contracts</p>
<p>A wide contract for a function or operation does not specify any undefined 
behavior. Such a contract has no preconditions: A function with a wide contract 
places no additional runtime constraints on its arguments, on any object state, 
nor on any external global state. Examples of functions having wide contracts 
would be vector&lt;T&gt;::begin() and vector&lt;T&gt;::at(size_type) . Examples of functions 
not having a wide contract would be vector&lt;T&gt;::front() and vector&lt;T&gt;::operator[](size_type) 
.</p>
<p>Narrow Contracts</p>
<p>A narrow contract is a contract which is not wide. Narrow contracts for a 
functions or operations result in undefined behavior when called in a manner 
that violates the documented contract. Such a contract specifies at least one 
precondition involving its arguments, object state, or some external global 
state, such as the initialization of</p>
<p>Guidelines for noexcept:</p>
<ul>
  <li>No library destructor should throw. They shall use the implicitly supplied 
  (non- throwing) exception specification. </li>
  <li>Each library function <del>having a wide contract,</del> that the LWG agree cannot 
  throw, should be marked as unconditionally noexcept.</li>
  <li>If a library swap function, move-constructor, or move-assignment operator 
  is conditionally-wide (i.e. can be proven to not throw by applying the 
  noexcept operator) then it should be marked as conditionally noexcept. No 
  other function should use a conditional noexcept specification.</li>
  <li>Library functions designed for compatibility with “C” code (such as the 
  atomics facility), may be marked as unconditionally noexcept.</li>
</ul>

<p>N3248 11-0018 noexcept Prevents Library Validation</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Peter Dimov:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>In my opinion, the current wide/narrow practice is wrong. </p>
  <p>It's wrong on a conceptual level, because (almost) no function is actually 
  wide. All functions have implicit requirements that their arguments, *this, 
  and everything else reachable from them be a valid object. (Or, in the case of 
  a constructor, that 'this' points to storage suitable to hold an object.) </p>
  <p>It's also wrong because it sets up a conflict. When specifying, say, 
  operator*, we now need to make a choice between adding a Requires clause and a 
  noexcept, the two being mutually exclusive under the wide/narrow theory. This 
  does not improve the quality of the specification. </p>
  <p>I understand the motivation for all that. The idea is that the requirements 
  are asserted, and the fact that the requirements are asserted is tested by 
  making the assertions throw. But somehow I don't find this sufficient cause to 
  degrade the specification of the standard library for everyone.</p>

<p>Dave Abrahams:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="il">[As regards not marking narrow functions noexcept] You</span>
<span class="il">should</span> <span class="il">ignore</span> <span class="il">
this</span> <span class="il">bad</span> <span class="il">advice</span>. Normally 
I'd say, &quot;IMO&quot; just to be polite, but I don't feel I <span class="il">should</span> 
do anything to soften <span class="il">this</span> statement. Preconditions and 
exceptions have no intrinsic relationship, and nothing <span class="il">should</span> 
be done to artificially connect them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alisdair Meredith replying to Dave:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the wonderful world of well-formed programs, Dave is correct. In the 
practical world of supporting potentially buggy software, we often want to offer 
library modes that help users find their problems quickly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dave replying to Alisdair:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Such library modes are allowed as extensions and shouldn't be written into 
the library spec.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Beman Dawes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In addition to the problems described by Peter and Dave, failing to mark a 
function nothrow is expensive.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>Clause 17 does not state overall policy for the use of noexcept in the 
standard library, except to allow implementers to add noexcept to non-virtual 
functions.</p>
<p>That creates several problems:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Library use of 17 is not subject to serious scrutiny</li>
</ul>
<p>As long as the LWG's policy on use of noexcept is not described in 17, 
library use of 17 is not subject to serious scrutiny by those not privy to the 
inner workings of the LWG. That includes both committee members and others who 
do not normally attend LWG discussions.</p>
<ul>
  <li>There is currently no way to know if noexcept applies to functions like 
  iterator member functions that are required by the standard, but do not appear 
  in any synopsis.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Authors of library proposal will have guidance as to when to apply 
  noxecept. </li>
</ul>
<p>By attempting to set a policy, serious debate can occur as to what the policy 
should be. This is important since several committee members believe the Nxxxx 
guidelines are not suitable for long term use.</p>
