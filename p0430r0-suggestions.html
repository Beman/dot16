<h1>Suggestions for changes to P0430R0</h1>
<h2>Presentation</h2>
<ul>
  <li>In existing WP wording, consider using code font where the WP uses code 
  font. That's a PITA, but helps readers quite a bit.</li>
  <li>In new WP wording, using code font becomes more important. Words like 
  &quot;path&quot; change their meaning if they are in code font, and the project editor, 
  his helpers, and other readers may not understand filesystem as the LWG does.</li>
  <li>It is sometimes hard to pick out the instructions to the editors. Perhaps use 
  italics - e.g. <i>Add the following enum class:</i></li>
  <li>My personal preference is to use background colors rather than font colors 
  to signify changes.&nbsp; +1 for not using underbars and strikethroughs.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Editorial wordsmithing</h2>
<ul>
  <li> <i>Add the following enum class</i> <i> <ins>to 27.10.10 [fs.enum]</ins>:</i></li>
  <li>pathname_format table row 1; The <del>format of the string_type argument is in</del> native <ins>pathname</ins> format
  <ins>([fs.def.native])</ins>.</li>
  <li>pathname_format table row 2; The <del>format of the string_type argument is in</del> 
  generic <ins>pathname</ins> format <ins>([path.generic]</ins>).</li>
  <li>The <del>directory</del> <ins>directory-like file type</ins> change to 
  27.10.13 [class.directory_iterator] is problematic because we don&#39;t have a 
  definition for &quot;directory-like file type&quot;. How about &quot;... files in a directory
  <ins>or in an implementation defined directory-like file type</ins>.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<h2>Substantive</h2>
<ul>
  <li><code>enum class pathname_format;</code> needs to be added to the 
  &quot;enumerations&quot; section of 27.10.6 Header &lt;filesystem&gt; synopsis [fs.filesystem.syn]. 
  But see the next three items.</li>
  <li dir="ltr">
  <p dir="ltr"><code>auto</code> is a C++ keyword, so can&#39;t be used as a <code>
  pathname_format</code> constant. But see the next item.</li>
  <li>
  <p dir="ltr">Should <code>pathname_format</code> even have an <code>auto</code> 
  constant? It seems simpler just to define the path constructor argument 
  default as <i><code>implementation-defined</code></i>.</li>
  <li>Did you consider making adding <code>enum format {native, generic};</code> 
  as a member of class <code>path</code>? Class <code>path</code> is the only 
  context it is used in, and the member enum allows users to write<code> 
  path::native</code> and <code>path::generic</code> rather than the longer
  <code>pathname_format::native</code> and <code>pathname_format::generic</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Serious concern over proposed changes to <b>27.10.8.2.1 [path.fmt.cvt]</b></h2>
<p>I agree with the intent of the proposed change to 27.10.8.2.1, but have a 
serious concern; the current wording is already supposed to say the same thing! 
That concern is best understood by looking at the change in the context of the 
entirety of 27.10.8.2.1, as shown below.</p>
<p>It is a basic tenet of writing standardese not to say the same thing twice 
using different wording. Violating this tenet causes endless problems because 
inevitably there are subtle differences in meaning between the two wordings.</p>
<p>If there is something wrong with the current paragraph two then that needs to be fixed, rather 
than adding a new and possibly conflicting paragraph.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>27.10.8.2.1 path argument format conversions [path.fmt.cvt]</b></p>
<p><ins><font size="1">new</font> Specifications for path appends, path concatenation, path modifiers, path 
decomposition and path query are in terms of the generic pathname format. An 
implementation needs to make whatever changes necessary to the pathname in 
native pathname format to produce the specified change in the generic pathname 
format, or return query result for pathname in terms of the generic pathname 
format.</ins></p>
<p><font size="1">1</font> [ Note: The format conversions described in this 
section are not applied on POSIX- or Windows-based operating systems because on 
these systems:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>— The generic format is acceptable as a native path.<br>
  — There is no need to distinguish between native format and generic format in 
  function arguments.<br>
  — Paths for regular files and paths for directories share the same syntax.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>—end note ]</p>
<p><font size="1">2</font> Function arguments that take character sequences 
representing paths may use the generic pathname format grammar (27.10.8.1) or 
the native pathname format (27.10.4.11). If and only if such arguments are in 
the generic format and the generic format is not acceptable to the operating 
system as a native path, conversion to native format shall be performed during 
the processing of the argument.</p>
<p><font size="1">3</font> [ Note: Some operating systems may have no 
unambiguous way to distinguish between native format and generic format 
arguments. This is by design as it simplifies use for operating systems that do 
not require disambiguation. An implementation for an operating system where 
disambiguation is required is permitted to distinguish between the formats. —end 
note ]</p>
<p><font size="1">4</font> If the native format requires paths for regular files 
to be formatted differently from paths for directories, the path shall be 
treated as a directory path if its last element is a directory-separator, 
otherwise it shall be treated as a path to a regular file.</p>
