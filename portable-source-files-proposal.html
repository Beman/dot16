<h1>Portable Program Source Files Proposal</h1>
<p>Even this simple program cannot be written portably in C++ and may fail to 
compile:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>int main() {}</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The problem is that &quot;The set of physical source file characters accepted is 
implementation-defined&quot; (2.2 Phases of translation [lex.phases] paragraph 1). So 
even though the above program&#39;s code is portable, the file that contains it is not.</p>
<p>This creates two problems:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It plays into the stereotype of C++ being unfriendly to Unicode, 
  particularly UTF-8.</li>
  <li>It can create problems for widely portable programs. Boost, for example, 
  even in source file comments cannot use the copyright sign (Â©) or the names of 
  some developers because of reports they cause compilation failures in some 
  environments.</li>
</ul>
<p>The fix is simple; continue to allow implementations their current latitude, 
but also require that the UTF-8 character set be accepted.</p>
<h2>Proposed change to the standard</h2>
<p><i>Change 2.2 Phases of translation [lex.phases] as indicated:</i></p>
  <blockquote>
<p>The precedence among the syntax rules of translation is specified by the 
following phases.11 </p>
<p>1. <ins>An implementation  accepts one or more sets of physical source file characters. 
One of the physical source file character sets accepted shall be UTF-8 without 
byte-order marker. Other physical source file character sets accepted, if any, 
are implementation-defined. A source file shall contain only one physical source 
file character set; how that set is determined is implementation defined.</ins> Physical source file characters are mapped, in an 
implementation-defined manner, to the basic source character set (introducing 
new-line characters for end-of-line indicators) if necessary. <del>The set of 
physical source file characters accepted is implementation-defined.</del> Trigraph 
sequences (2.4) are replaced by corresponding single-character internal 
representations. Any source file character not in the basic source character set 
(2.3) is replaced by the universal-character-name that designates that 
character. (An implementation may use any internal encoding, so long as an 
actual extended character encountered in the source file, and the same extended 
character expressed in the source file as a universal-character-name (i.e., 
using the \uXXXX notation), are handled equivalently except where this 
replacement is reverted in a raw string literal.)</p>
