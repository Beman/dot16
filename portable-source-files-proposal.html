<h1>Portable Program Source Files <span style="background-color: #FFFF99">
(Draft)</span></h1>
<p>Even this simple program cannot be written portably in C++ and may fail to 
compile:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>int main() {}</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The problem is that &quot;The set of physical source file characters accepted is 
implementation-defined&quot; (2.2 Phases of translation [lex.phases] paragraph 
1). So even though the above program&#39;s code is portable, to actually compile 
it the file may require a cumbersome encoding conversion plus conversion of all 
characters not available in the compiler accepted physical character set to the 
appropriate universal character names, alternate tokens, digraphs, and trigraphs.</p>
<p>This creates two problems:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It plays into the stereotype of C++ being unfriendly to Unicode, 
  particularly UTF-8.</li>
  <li>It can create problems for widely portable programs. Boost source files, for example, cannot use the copyright sign (Â©) or the names of 
  some Boost developers even in comments because they cause some compilers to 
  reject the source file.</li>
</ul>
<p>The proposed fix is simple; continue to allow implementations their current latitude 
with regard to physical source file character sets, 
but add a requirement that the UTF-8 character set be accepted.</p>
<p>This ensures that a UTF-8 encoded source file is acceptable to all compilers 
on all systems. It does not address other character set related challenges in 
writing truly portable code, such the effect of conversion of character or 
string literals of source character set members to the execution character set 
([lex.phases], paragraph 5). Every journey begins with a single step, and that&#39;s 
all this proposal provides; the first step.</p>
<p>The proposed wording below is intended to require no changes to any existing 
source files and no changes to compilers that already recognize UTF-8 source 
files with byte-order marker.</p>
<h2>Proposed change to the standard</h2>
<p><i>Change 2.2 Phases of translation [lex.phases] paragraph 1, bullet 1 as indicated:</i></p>
  <blockquote>
<p>The precedence among the syntax rules of translation is specified by the 
following phases.<sup>11</sup> </p>
<p>1. <ins>An implementation  accepts one or more physical source file character 
sets. 
One of the physical source file character sets accepted shall be UTF-8 with 0xEFBBBF 
byte-order marker. Any additional physical source file character sets accepted 
are implementation-defined. A source file shall contain only one physical source 
file character set; how that character set is determined is implementation defined.</ins> Physical source file characters are mapped, in an 
implementation-defined manner, to the basic source character set (introducing 
new-line characters for end-of-line indicators) if necessary. <del>The set of 
physical source file characters accepted is implementation-defined.</del> Trigraph 
sequences (2.4) are replaced by corresponding single-character internal 
representations. Any source file character not in the basic source character set 
(2.3) is replaced by the universal-character-name that designates that 
character. (An implementation may use any internal encoding, so long as an 
actual extended character encountered in the source file, and the same extended 
character expressed in the source file as a universal-character-name (i.e., 
using the \uXXXX notation), are handled equivalently except where this 
replacement is reverted in a raw string literal.)</p>
  </blockquote>
<h2>Rationale</h2>
<h3>UTF-8</h3>
<p>UTF-8 is recommended as the required physical source file character set 
because it is an ISO standard (ISO/IEC 10646 annex D), is the de facto 
standard for byte-oriented character set encodings, and is already supported by several C++ compilers. </p>
<h3>Byte-order marker</h3>
<p>The proposed wording requires a 
byte-order marker to assist compilers that wish to auto-detect  
UTF-8 encoding. Compilers are still permitted to accept UTF-8 source files without 
byte-order markers. The Unicode Technical Committee says of a 0xEFBBBF 
byte-order marker that &quot;its presence does not affect conformance to the UTF-8 
encoding scheme.&quot;</p>
<h3>Digraphs and Trigraphs</h3>
<p>Jeremiah Willcock asks &quot;would it make sense to disable digraphs and trigraphs 
in UTF-8 files...&quot;? This proposal makes no changes in the handling of digraph 
and trigraph sequences to avoid possible breakage of existing source files. 
But if the number of existing C++ source files that are UTF-8 encoded with BOM
<b>and</b> use digraphs or trigraphs is believed to be very small, the committee may wish to 
consider such a change.</p>
