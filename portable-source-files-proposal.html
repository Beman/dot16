<h1>Portable Program Source Files <span style="background-color: #FFFF99">
(Draft)</span></h1>
<p>Even this simple program cannot be written portably in C++ and may fail to 
compile:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>int main() {}</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The problem is that &quot;The set of physical source file characters accepted is 
implementation-defined&quot; (2.2 Phases of translation [lex.phases] paragraph 1). So 
even though the above program&#39;s code is portable, the file that contains it is not.</p>
<p>This creates two problems:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It plays into the stereotype of C++ being unfriendly to Unicode, 
  particularly UTF-8.</li>
  <li>It can create problems for widely portable programs. Boost source files, for example, cannot use the copyright sign (Â©) or the names of 
  some developers even in comments because there have been reports of compilation failures.</li>
</ul>
<p>The fix is simple; continue to allow implementations their current latitude, 
but also require that the UTF-8 character set be accepted.</p>
<h2>Proposed change to the standard</h2>
<p><i>Change 2.2 Phases of translation [lex.phases] as indicated:</i></p>
  <blockquote>
<p>The precedence among the syntax rules of translation is specified by the 
following phases.11 </p>
<p>1. <ins>An implementation  accepts one or more sets of physical source file characters. 
One of the physical source file character sets accepted shall be UTF-8 with or without 
byte-order marker. Any other physical source file character sets accepted 
are implementation-defined. A source file shall contain only one physical source 
file character set; how that character set is determined is implementation defined.</ins> Physical source file characters are mapped, in an 
implementation-defined manner, to the basic source character set (introducing 
new-line characters for end-of-line indicators) if necessary. <del>The set of 
physical source file characters accepted is implementation-defined.</del> Trigraph 
sequences (2.4) are replaced by corresponding single-character internal 
representations. Any source file character not in the basic source character set 
(2.3) is replaced by the universal-character-name that designates that 
character. (An implementation may use any internal encoding, so long as an 
actual extended character encountered in the source file, and the same extended 
character expressed in the source file as a universal-character-name (i.e., 
using the \uXXXX notation), are handled equivalently except where this 
replacement is reverted in a raw string literal.)</p>
  </blockquote>
<h2>Rationale</h2>
<h3>UTF-8</h3>
<p>UTF-8 is recommended as the required physical source file character set 
because it is an ISO standard (ISO/IEC 10646 annex D), is the de facto 
standard for byte-oriented character set encodings, and is already supported by several C++ compilers. </p>
<h3>Byte-order marker</h3>
<p>The Unicode Technical Committee says of a 0xEFBBBF byte-order marker that 
&quot;Its usage at the beginning of a UTF-8 data stream is neither required nor 
recommended by the Unicode Standard&quot; although &quot;its presence does not affect 
conformance to the UTF-8 encoding scheme.&quot; The proposed wording chose &quot;with or 
without&quot; for maximum flexibility.</p>
<p>The committee may wish to query compiler vendors to better understand 
existing practice as regards byte-order markers. </p>
