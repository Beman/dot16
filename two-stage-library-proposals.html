<p>Traditionally, calls for proposals for new C++ standard library components 
have required &quot;<b><i>Proposed Text for the Standard</i></b>&quot; in the form of full 
standardese. This requirement discourages the submission of worthwhile 
proposals:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Writing standardese is daunting for those who do not have experience with 
  this very specialized language. Learning to write standardese just isn't worth 
  it for a proposal that may be rejected anyhow.</p>
  <p>Writing standardese is very time consuming, even for those who have written 
  a lot of standardese. Requiring full standardese for a proposal that may be 
  rejected anyhow is unreasonable, particularly for large and complex libraries.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet for smaller proposals it may be possible to find volunteers to write the 
actual standardese, and for larger proposals volunteers can help a library 
author learn the basics and review wording. But the current procedure creates a 
chicken-and-egg problem; a proposal is needed to attract volunteers, but without 
volunteers it is too hard to write a proposal.</p>
